[Amazon Kinesis](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/introduction.html) provides collection and processing of large
[streams](https://aws.amazon.com/streaming-data/) of data records in real time. Kinesis data streams can be used for rapid and continuous data
intake and aggregation.

## Streams

Amazon Kinesis Data Streams ingests a large amount of data in real time, durably stores the data, and makes the data available for consumption.

Using the CDK, a new Kinesis stream can be created as part of the stack using the construct's constructor. You may specify the `streamName` to give
your own identifier to the stream. If not, CloudFormation will generate a name.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
Stream(self, "MyFirstStream",
    stream_name="my-awesome-stream"
)
```

You can also specify properties such as `shardCount` to indicate how many shards the stream should choose and a `retentionPeriod`
to specify how long the data in the shards should remain accessible.
Read more at [Creating and Managing Streams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/working-with-streams.html)

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
Stream(self, "MyFirstStream",
    stream_name="my-awesome-stream",
    shard_count=3,
    retention_period=Duration.hours(48)
)
```

### Encryption

[Stream encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-kinesis-stream-streamencryption.html) enables
server-side encryption using an AWS KMS key for a specified stream.

Encryption is enabled by default on your stream with the master key owned by Kinesis Data Streams in regions where it is supported.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
Stream(self, "MyEncryptedStream")
```

You can enable encryption on your stream with a user-managed key by specifying the `encryption` property.
A KMS key will be created for you and associated with the stream.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
Stream(self, "MyEncryptedStream",
    encryption=StreamEncryption.KMS
)
```

You can also supply your own external KMS key to use for stream encryption by specifying the `encryptionKey` property.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
import aws_cdk.aws_kms as kms

key = kms.Key(self, "MyKey")

Stream(self, "MyEncryptedStream",
    encryption=StreamEncryption.KMS,
    encryption_key=key
)
```

### Import

Any Kinesis stream that has been created outside the stack can be imported into your CDK app.

Streams can be imported by their ARN via the `Stream.fromStreamArn()` API

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
stack = Stack(app, "MyStack")

imported_stream = Stream.from_stream_arn(stack, "ImportedStream", "arn:aws:kinesis:us-east-2:123456789012:stream/f3j09j2230j")
```

Encrypted Streams can also be imported by their attributes via the `Stream.fromStreamAttributes()` API

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
from aws_cdk.aws_kms import Key

stack = Stack(app, "MyStack")

imported_stream = Stream.from_stream_attributes(stack, "ImportedEncryptedStream",
    stream_arn="arn:aws:kinesis:us-east-2:123456789012:stream/f3j09j2230j",
    encryption_key=kms.Key.from_key_arn("arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012")
)
```

### Permission Grants

IAM roles, users or groups which need to be able to work with Amazon Kinesis streams at runtime should be granted IAM permissions.

Any object that implements the `IGrantable` interface (has an associated principal) can be granted permissions by calling:

* `grantRead(principal)` - grants the principal read access
* `grantWrite(principal)` - grants the principal write permissions to a Stream
* `grantReadWrite(principal)` - grants principal read and write permissions

#### Read Permissions

Grant `read` access to a stream by calling the `grantRead()` API.
If the stream has an encryption key, read permissions will also be granted to the key.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
lambda_role = iam.Role(self, "Role",
    assumed_by=iam.ServicePrincipal("lambda.amazonaws.com"),
    description="Example role..."
)

stream = Stream(self, "MyEncryptedStream",
    encryption=StreamEncryption.KMS
)

# give lambda permissions to read stream
stream.grant_read(lambda_role)
```

The following read permissions are provided to a service principal by the `grantRead()` API:

* `kinesis:DescribeStreamSummary`
* `kinesis:GetRecords`
* `kinesis:GetShardIterator`
* `kinesis:ListShards`
* `kinesis:SubscribeToShard`

#### Write Permissions

Grant `write` permissions to a stream is provided by calling the `grantWrite()` API.
If the stream has an encryption key, write permissions will also be granted to the key.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
lambda_role = iam.Role(self, "Role",
    assumed_by=iam.ServicePrincipal("lambda.amazonaws.com"),
    description="Example role..."
)

stream = Stream(self, "MyEncryptedStream",
    encryption=StreamEncryption.KMS
)

# give lambda permissions to write to stream
stream.grant_write(lambda_role)
```

The following write permissions are provided to a service principal by the `grantWrite()` API:

* `kinesis:ListShards`
* `kinesis:PutRecord`
* `kinesis:PutRecords`

#### Custom Permissions

You can add any set of permissions to a stream by calling the `grant()` API.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
user = iam.User(stack, "MyUser")

stream = Stream(stack, "MyStream")

# give my user permissions to list shards
stream.grant(user, "kinesis:ListShards")
```

### Metrics

You can use common metrics from your stream to create alarms and/or dashboards. The `stream.metric('MetricName')` method creates a metric with the stream namespace and dimension. You can also use pre-define methods like `stream.metricGetRecordsSuccess()`. To find out more about Kinesis metrics check [Monitoring the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Service with Amazon CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/monitoring-with-cloudwatch.html).

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
stream = Stream(stack, "MyStream")

# Using base metric method passing the metric name
stream.metric("GetRecords.Success")

# using pre-defined metric method
stream.metric_get_records_success()

# using pre-defined and overriding the statistic
stream.metric_get_records_success(statistic="Maximum")
```
